# This an example of how to use SSE and how to use Nodemailer to send mails
* Using SSE (Server Sent Events) in a Node.js-backend and JS/React-based frontend to accomplish real-time communication from the server to the client. (SSE is an alternative to web sockets and Socket.io).
* Using Nodemailer to send a mail through a gmail account that we have an application secret for.

**Important:** The file with the email account addresss and secret we obtain from Gmail is git-ignored and should be that, it shouldn't be part of our repository, since this is sensitive information that can be used by hackers.

# Install
* npm install

# Run backend and frontend at the same time
* npm start
